# Salon-Appointment
A FreeCodeCamp relational database challenge

In this challenge I build a salon database. In this db, three tables are created: appointments, customers and services. 
1. The code to rebuild the database is in salon.sql.
2. Then the bash script salon.sh is used to interact with a customer and fill the tables.
